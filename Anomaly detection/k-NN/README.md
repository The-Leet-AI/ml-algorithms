# **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It is based on the idea that an object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors. Given a dataset of labeled data points and a new data point, KNN algorithm will find the K nearest neighbors (based on some distance metric) from the training dataset and classify the new data point based on the majority class of these nearest neighbors.

## **How the Algorithm Works**
1) Load the training dataset: The first step is to load the training dataset and extract features and class labels from it.
2) Choose the value of K: Choose the value of K, which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification. A common approach is to choose an odd number for K to avoid ties.
3) Calculate Distance: For a new data point, calculate the distance between this data point and all the data points in the training dataset using a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.
4) Find the K nearest neighbors: Sort the distances in ascending order and pick the K nearest neighbors.
5) Classify the new data point: Based on the majority class of the K nearest neighbors, classify the new data point.

## **Data**
The data used in this K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a collection of emails, where each email is represented by a set of features. These features could include things like the frequency of certain words or characters, the presence or absence of certain words, and other statistical information.

The goal of the algorithm is to classify each email as either spam or non-spam based on its features. To do this, the algorithm uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach, where the email is classified based on the class of the K nearest emails to it in the feature space.

The data used in this code is stored in two files, "data/spambase/spambase.data" and "data/spambase/test_data.data". The first file contains the training data that is used to train the model, while the second file contains the test data that is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

In the code, the data is loaded into a NumPy array, and the class of each email is stored in the last column of the array. The features for each email are stored in the columns before that. The model is trained on the training data, and the accuracy is evaluated on the test data using the `score` method of the `KNeighborsClassifier` class from the `scikit-learn` library.

## **Implementation in the Provided Code**
The provided code implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using the `KNeighborsClassifier` class from the scikit-learn library. The code loads the training dataset and performs 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The value of K is set to 5, which means the algorithm will consider the 5 nearest neighbors for each new data point.

In the `run` function, the dataset is shuffled randomly, and the class labels and features are extracted from the dataset. The KNN classifier is then trained on the features, and the cross-validation accuracy is computed and printed. If the `save_model` parameter is set to `True`, the trained KNN model is saved to a file named 'k-nearest-neighbors-model.pkl'. If the `test_data` parameter is provided, the code will use the trained model to predict the class labels for the test data, and the accuracy of the prediction is computed and printed.

Finally, in the `main` function, the training dataset is loaded, and the `run` function is called with the required parameters. The code also loads the test dataset and passes it as the `test_data` parameter to the `run` function.

The most important parts of the code are:

* `KNeighborsClassifier` class initialization: This is where the KNN classifier is created, and the value of K (number of nearest neighbors) is set to 5.
* `cross_val_score` function: This function is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model by performing 10-fold cross-validation. The accuracy values are computed for each fold, and the minimum, maximum, mean, and variance of the accuracy are printed.
* `clf.score` function: This function is used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction on the test data.

## **Conclusion**
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple and straightforward algorithm for classification and regression problems. The provided code implements the algorithm in an easy-to-follow manner and provides a good starting point for further experimentation and improvement.
